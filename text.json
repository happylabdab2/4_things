    "If you are a young person — by young person I mean 19 and younger, though young-at-hearters aren't excluded. Nor are older people. Or old people. But I’m speaking primarily to young people. Anyway, if you are a young person, the following are 4 things I’ve been meaning to say to you:",
    "",
    "1. Don’t be scared. I know many people are nervous about starting middle school—I was too! But I decided to stay strong. It’s normal to feel unsure about the new environment and routines, but staying calm and confident makes a big difference. I saw some people who let fear take over and had a hard time adjusting, like being late to class or getting overwhelmed by the new arrangements. Remember, everyone is figuring things out together, so give yourself grace and take it one step at a time.;point_1_highlight;point_1_emoji",
    "",
    "2. Take charge. When you arrive, take charge. If you play your cards right, treat everyone fairly and with kindness, and go with the popular opinion when it feels right, you’ll meet many great people. You might even pick up a friend or two over your shared interests.;point_2_spacing;point_2_emoji",
    "",
    "3. Reflect on everything. Good or bad, take time to reflect on it. Think about what you could have done differently in a situation, consider things from others’ perspectives, and imagine what your future 8th-grade self would think. Always remember that every decision matters and helps shape who you become.;point_3_italic;point_3_emoji",
    "",
    "4. Learn to advocate for yourself. If you're struggling with a subject, don't be afraid to ask your teacher for help. If you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to a trusted adult. Learning to advocate for yourself is an important life skill.;point_4_highlight;point_4_emoji",
